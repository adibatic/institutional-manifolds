## Overview

This project moves beyond discrete regime typologies by modeling state architecture as a continuous, low-dimensional **Diffusion Manifold**. Using cross-national longitudinal data, we map the "shape" of governance through time, identifying topological voids in developmental space and classifying state trajectories based on their geometric efficiency.

## Visualizing the Manifold

### Key Methodology & Findings
* **Diffusion Maps:** Capturing non-linear relationships in institutional data (V-Dem & WDI) to define a "Reference Manifold."
* **Topological Data Analysis (TDA):** Identifying "Developmental Voids" via Vietoris-Rips complexes—regions of the state-space that are historically or structurally inaccessible.
* **Trajectory Typologies:** Classifying country movements (1990–2026) into Direct, Meandering, and Erratic paths based on Log-Tortuosity and geodesic efficiency.
* **Standardized Distribution:** Using normalized density estimation to compare the systemic complexity across different developmental regimes.
* **Systemic Dispersion:** Measuring the expansion and contraction of the global "swarm" of nations across the manifold over time.

## Data Requirements

This analysis utilizes the **Quality of Government (QoG) Standard Dataset** (Jan 2026 release). Due to size and licensing, it is not included in this repository.

1. Download the `qog_std_cs_jan26.csv` and `qog_std_ts_jan26.csv` files from the [official QoG Institute website](https://www.gu.se/en/quality-government/qog-data/data-downloads/standard-dataset).
2. Place both `.csv` files directly into the `data/` directory.

## Installation & Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adibatic/governance-topology.git
   cd governance-topology
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the analysis:**
   Open `src/analysis.ipynb` and run the cells sequentially. In addition to generating the global figures, use the analyze_country_trajectory("Country Name") function in the final cells to generate high-resolution phase-space and velocity diagnostics for any specific nation.

## Writing & Manuscript

The manuscript is located in the `paper/` directory. 
* To compile the PDF locally, ensure you have a LaTeX distribution (such as TeX Live or MiKTeX) installed.
* Open `paper/main.tex` in your editor and compile using `latexmk` or the LaTeX Workshop extension.
* Note: The manuscript is configured to pull vector figures (PDF) directly from the `figures/` directory.
